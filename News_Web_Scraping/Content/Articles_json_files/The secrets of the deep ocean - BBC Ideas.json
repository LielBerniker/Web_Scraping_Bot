{"name": "The secrets of the deep ocean - BBC Ideas", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/ideas/videos/the-secrets-of-the-deep-ocean/p0c8gybb", "content": "made with the help of dr matthieu cartigny of the university of durham and prof kerry howell from the university of plymouth. voiceover: kanishk tharoor narrator: the ocean covers over 70% of our planet. and yet, what we know about it barely scratches the surface. beneath its swell is a largely unexplored universe, until recently beyond the gaze of human eyes. so why do we know so little about the ocean? for a start, immense pressure presents huge challenges for divers and equipment alike. in many ways, it\u2019s easier to send a mission to space. but with new technology such as submarine robots, this hidden realm is starting to reveal its secrets. so, what\u2019s down there? well, there\u2019s water. lots of it. 1,419,120,000 cubic kilometres, to be about as precise as you can be. and in that water, there\u2019s fish - the main source of protein for around three billion people. but there\u2019s a lot more than just fish down there. extraordinary, otherworldly creatures dwell in the depths, with new ones discovered all the time. many are gelatinous - jellyfish that disintegrate if you try to catch them in a net. in 2020, scientists found the giant siphonophore apolemia, an organism made up of millions of interconnected clones, its thin twisting body reminiscent of a long piece of string. and the ocean floor is far from being the flat and featureless seabed you might imagine. if you were to drain the ocean, a landscape would emerge just as spectacular as anything on land - boasting some of the highest peaks, deepest canyons and longest river channels on the planet. there are even waterfalls under the sea - the largest being the denmark strait cataract. here, the cold waters of the greenland sea meet the warmer waters of the irminger. as the cooler water is forced down, it creates a giant three and a half thousand metre drop, undetectable to anyone who might be bobbing about on the surface. and that\u2019s nothing compared to the chilling 11,000-metre drop to the bottom of the mariana trench - the deepest place on earth. it was here that, in 2020, scientists made an alarming discovery. at a depth of around 7,000 metres, in one of the most remote and inaccessible crevices on earth, they came across a new species of crustacean. and it had plastic in its stomach. they called it eurythenes plasticus - a living reminder that even though we\u2019ve barely begun to explore the ocean, our impact on it is already being keenly felt. in fact, by 2050, it\u2019s estimated there could be more plastic in the sea than fish. but it\u2019s not just plastic that\u2019s a problem. climate change is altering the basic chemistry of the oceans, both warming and acidifying the water. there are also \u201cdead zones\u201d, areas with insufficient oxygen to support marine life. these are becoming more common thanks to pollution. the sad truth is, when it comes to the ocean, the reach of human activity goes far beyond the reach of our knowledge. it\u2019s easy to feel detached from the ocean - particularly if you live inland. and this might explain why we\u2019ve treated it as a dumping ground. but the more we explore, the more we find it has to offer. the gene pool of deep ocean life, such as sponges and microorganisms, could hold the key to solving the urgent problem of antibiotic resistance. more importantly, the ocean is key to almost all life on the planet: half the oxygen we breathe comes from marine photosynthesizers such as phytoplankton and seaweed. the ocean also regulates our climate, mediating temperature by distributing solar heat around the planet. we may not feel it, but every one of us is affected every day by the role the ocean plays in our finely-balanced earth system. and yet, the efforts we\u2019ve made so far to protect and preserve this vital life source are, well, a drop in the ocean. there\u2019s still so much we don\u2019t know - so many breathtaking canyons unseen, so many creatures undiscovered - but new technology is revealing more about our ocean than ever before. perhaps if we knew more of the ocean\u2019s secrets, we might look after it better.
